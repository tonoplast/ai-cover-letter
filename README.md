## How It Works

- **RAG Pipeline:** All cover letter generation (manual or batch) uses a RAG pipeline with MiniLM embeddings to retrieve the most relevant content from your uploaded documents, weighted by recency.
- **Writing Style:** Your writing style is learned from all previous cover letters, with more weight to recent ones.
- **LLM Generation:** The LLM receives a prompt with your experiences, writing style, and the most relevant document chunks.
- **Consistent Output:** Whether you enter job info manually or scrape from a website, the same logic and context are used for tailored, authentic cover letters.

## Advanced Features

- **LinkedIn Integration:** Import your LinkedIn profile for richer context.
- **Company Research:** Use multiple providers for company info, with fallback and rate limiting.
- **Anti-bot Scraping:** Selenium-based fallback for protected job sites, with configurable delays.
- **Selective Deletion:** Delete individual or multiple documents, cover letters, or experiences from the database.
- **Visual Diff:** See changes between original and revised cover letters in the chat interface.

## Troubleshooting

- **403/Blocked on Scraping:** Increase delay between jobs, or use manual job description input for protected sites.
- **No CV Uploaded:** Upload at least one CV for best RAG results.
- **LLM Not Responding:** Check your Ollama or LLM server is running and accessible.
