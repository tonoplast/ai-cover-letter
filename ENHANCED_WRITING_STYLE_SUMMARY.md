# Enhanced Writing Style Analysis System

## Overview

The AI Cover Letter Generator has been significantly enhanced with a sophisticated writing style analysis system that captures and replicates the user's personal writing style in generated cover letters. This addresses the issue where generated cover letters sounded generic and didn't match the user's actual writing voice.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: Generated cover letters used generic language (like "honed") that didn't reflect the user's personal writing style, making them sound artificial and not authentic to the user's voice.

**After**: The system now captures the user's actual vocabulary, phrases, sentence structures, and writing patterns to generate cover letters that sound like they were written by the user themselves.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Writing Style Analysis (`app/services/document_parser.py`)

The `_analyze_writing_style` method has been completely rewritten to capture:

#### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Common words**: Extracts the most frequently used words (excluding common stop words)
- **Common phrases**: Identifies 2-word and 3-word phrase patterns
- **Sentence starters**: Captures how the user typically begins sentences
- **Vocabulary diversity**: Measures the richness of the user's vocabulary

#### Style Characteristics
- **Transition words**: Detects use of connectors (however, furthermore, etc.)
- **Action verbs**: Identifies strong action verbs (developed, implemented, etc.)
- **Professional terms**: Recognizes industry-specific terminology
- **Personal pronouns**: Measures the level of personal voice vs formal tone

#### Tone Analysis
- **Enthusiastic words**: Detects passion and excitement indicators
- **Confident words**: Identifies expressions of certainty and confidence
- **Formality level**: Assesses the overall formality of the writing

#### Structural Analysis
- **Sentence length**: Average words per sentence
- **Paragraph length**: Average words per paragraph
- **Writing patterns**: Boolean flags for various style characteristics

### 2. Intelligent Style Instructions (`app/services/cover_letter_gen.py`)

The `_create_writing_style_instructions` method converts the analyzed writing style into specific, actionable instructions for the LLM:

#### Structured Instructions
- **Writing style overview**: Human-readable summary of the style
- **Vocabulary guidance**: Specific words and phrases to incorporate
- **Sentence structure**: Guidelines for sentence length and complexity
- **Voice and tone**: Clear instructions on personal vs formal voice
- **Professional elements**: When to use transitions, action verbs, etc.

### 3. Enhanced LLM Extraction (`app/services/document_parser.py`)

The cover letter extraction prompt now requests detailed writing style information:

```json
{
  "writing_style": {
    "style_description": "brief description of overall writing style",
    "common_words": ["word1", "word2", "word3"],
    "common_phrases": ["phrase1", "phrase2"],
    "sentence_patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"],
    "vocabulary_level": "simple/moderate/advanced",
    "voice": "first-person/third-person/mixed",
    "transitions": ["transition1", "transition2"],
    "action_verbs": ["verb1", "verb2", "verb3"],
    "professional_terms": ["term1", "term2", "term3"],
    "enthusiasm_level": "low/moderate/high",
    "confidence_level": "low/moderate/high",
    "formality_level": "casual/professional/very formal"
  }
}
```

### 4. RAG Integration

The writing style analysis integrates with the existing RAG system:

- **Recency weighting**: More recent cover letters get higher weight in style analysis
- **Document type weighting**: Cover letters are weighted higher than other documents
- **Context enhancement**: Writing style is considered alongside content relevance

## How It Works

### 1. Style Capture
When a user uploads a cover letter, the system:
1. Analyzes the text using the enhanced `_analyze_writing_style` method
2. Extracts vocabulary, phrases, and writing patterns
3. Identifies tone, voice, and structural characteristics
4. Stores the analysis in the document's `parsed_data`

### 2. Style Aggregation
When generating a new cover letter, the system:
1. Retrieves all previous cover letters from the database
2. Applies recency weighting (more recent = higher weight)
3. Merges writing styles using weighted averages
4. Creates comprehensive style instructions

### 3. Style Application
The LLM receives detailed instructions like:
```
WRITING STYLE INSTRUCTIONS:
- WRITING STYLE OVERVIEW: Writing style: uses balanced sentence lengths; writes in a personal, first-person voice; uses professional terminology
- FREQUENTLY USED WORDS: Incorporate these words naturally: with, data, that, your, team, career, have, particularly
- COMMON PHRASES: Use these phrase patterns: with my, to your, your team, i have
- SENTENCE STARTERS: Begin sentences with: dear, with, throughout
- PROFESSIONAL TERMINOLOGY: Include professional terms (strategy, initiative, collaboration, etc.)
- VOICE: Write in a personal, first-person voice using 'I' statements
- TONE: Express confidence and certainty in your abilities
- SENTENCE STRUCTURE: Use balanced sentence lengths
- PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE: Use shorter, focused paragraphs
```

## Example Results

### Before Enhancement
Generated cover letter might use generic language:
> "I have honed my skills in data analysis and am excited to contribute to your team."

### After Enhancement
Generated cover letter matches user's style:
> "With my extensive experience in data analysis, I am confident that I can make significant contributions to your team. Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to develop innovative solutions that drive business value."
